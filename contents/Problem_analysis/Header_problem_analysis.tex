In the problem analysis chapter a theoretical overview of essential topics encapsulating the study of pain will be presented. First, the mechanisms involved in the experience of pain will be described, and how the metabolic response of brain activation can be translated into images. Subsequently, differences in the experience of pain between individuals will be outlined, along with the possible difficulties in interpreting the corresponding images. Lastly, different methods to counter these difficulties will be presented, thereby laying the foundation for understanding the problems faced when studying the differences in the individualâ€™s experience of pain.
