\section{The Hemodynamic Response}

As specified in the prior section, certain brain regions are activated when the body is subjected to a noxious stimuli. To further understand the regions activated during the experience of pain and how this activity is modulated by the brain, a measure of brain activation is therefore needed. To get a measure of brain activation, the underlaying physiologic response of a brain region activation is therefore of great importance to understand. 

The activation of a brain region starts with a neurological input containing information about the noxius stimuli \cite{Tracey2007}. The increased neurological activity effects local metabolism as processing of the signal requires adenosine triphosphate (ATP) consumption during e.g. the reception and reformation of the action potential. Thus, ATP starts to be processed, leading to a decrease in oxygen concentration and increase in waste products. Thereby, the metabolic need for oxygen increases. Subsequently, these factors present in the local tissue of the corresponding brain region activate a vasodilation, increasing the blood flow to that region to reestablish the local homeostasis. During this regulation a not yes fully understood phenomenon occurs as more oxygenated blood than needed to compensate for the offset is delivered. Thereby flooding the local region with oxygenated blood. This response to the increased neural activity is known as the hemodynamic response. The overall increase in neural activity in that specific region following the need for metabolic regulation thereby permits the measure of the hemodynamic response, hence becoming an indirect measure of the neural activity. An example illustrating the hemodynamic response can se found in \figref{fig:back:HRF}. \cite{Glover2011,Poldrack2011}

\Figref{fig:back:HRF} should be considered the perfect noiseless hemodynamic response curve, to a brief stimuli, though the reality is that the response is effected by physiologic noise parameters and would be delayed in time compared to the stimuli onset. The peak height of the curve is commonly the most interesting feature of the response, as it portrays the amount of neural activity. The time to peak will occur 4-6 seconds after stimulus onset. The duration of a response is around 20 seconds. There will further be a noticeable initial dip of 1-2 seconds duration, when the initial oxygen reserves are used up and a 20 second poststimulus undershoot as homeostasis is reestablished. \cite{Poldrack2011}
