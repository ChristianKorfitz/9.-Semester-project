\section{Individual differences in pain perception and fMRI}
The study of individual differences is basically to examine how each individual respond to the same intervention. This has been of great interest in medical fields ranging from psychology to pain research, as an understanding of each individual would shape more precise treatments given the individual’s unique characteristics. However, understanding why individuals react differently across sensory modalities has for long been a perplexing problem. In pain research, studies have shown that individuals report a large difference in pain sensitivity on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), when exposed to identical noxious stimuli \cite{Nielsen2008, Coghill2003}. This could indicate that individuals have different neurological responses to the same noxious stimuli, but on the other hand raise questions about the individual: is the subject over/underplaying the pain experience or engaging in drug seeking behavior? Thus, in the treatment of pain it has been of great interest to examine if the subjectively reported pain experience correlates with the actual neurological response in the individual. \cite{Coghill2011} \\
An indirect measure of functional brain response can be achieved through a BOLD fMRI scanning, and is often used to get a generic understanding of brain function in research. Averaging data across individuals is commonly applied to raise the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, while providing a general knowledge on brain function, this practice excludes the possibility of observing brain function in the individual. The interest of examining individual differences in brain activity has been present for several years, but the technology has only during recent years been advanced enough for it to be carried out, due to higher magnetic field strength and faster acquisition time. \cite{Dubois2016} \\
In 1999 and 2003 Coghill et al. \cite{Coghill1999, Coghill2003} published studies showing correlation between intensity of activation of specific brain regions associated with processing of noxious stimuli and subjects’ subjective pain sensitivity. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans and BOLD fMRI in a 1.5 tesla scanner was used respectively in the two studies for functional brain mapping . However, as Dubois et al. \cite{Dubois2016} emphasize only during the recent years the MRI technology has been advanced enough to create images with sufficient SNR to use as means in studying individual differences. A review study by Wood et al. \cite{Wood2012} comparing 1.5 tesla and 3.0 tesla scanners, showed that using the BOLD fMRI technique can produce better susceptibility contrast sensitivity and due to the naturally higher SNR in 3.0 tesla scanners a 40 percentage increase in activation detection can be generated. \\
In that relation, a validation of the 2003 study by Coghill et al. \cite{Coghill2003} with data from a 3.0 tesla scanner would be relevant. Further reasoning for a validation study is that clinics tend to get higher tesla scanners installed, when desiring to get finer images in fMRI \cite{Wood2012}. Thus, the future of fMRI lies within the use of higher tesla scanners. Furthermore, to raise the reproducibility in a validation study the number of participants included should be raised to examine if statistically significant result can be found in a higher sample size \cite{Dubois2016, Button2013}. \\
However, a downside of 3.0 tesla scanners compared to 1.5 tesla scanners is that artifacts related to motion, respiration, bloodflow, pulsation of cerebrospinal fluid and air-tissue interfaces are more prominent \cite{Wood2012}. In that relation, examining different types of preprocessing methods to denoise the images would be of high interest.
