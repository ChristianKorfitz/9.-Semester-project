The background chapter has the purpose of providing the theoretical overview for some of the essential techniques and methods utilized in this project, thereby laying the foundation for understanding how these methods work and how variations of these can be used for the problems the current project aims to solve. With the main goal of finding the optimal method for denoising functional Magnetic Resonance Images, the background chapter will introduce the following topics: first a brief overview of MRI physics and image reconstruction describing the origin behind the images is made, secondly the theory behind fMRI is introduced explaining the concept of mapping brain activity, afterwards different designs for inducing stimuli is presented, subsequently a pool of common preprocessing methods are introduced followed by sections explaining the principles of independent components analysis and principal component analysis, finally a section describing the commonly used method for testing statistical significance is made.
