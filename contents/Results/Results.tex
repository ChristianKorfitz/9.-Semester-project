\section{Comparison of FSL FIX and Standard Preprocessing}

The following section will present the results using both the standard preprocessing pipeline and FSL FIX pipeline. First, the signal of brain activation related to the 48$^\circ$ stimulus, achieved from using both methods is presented. Secondly, will the difference in amount if activation achieved by using FSL FIX compared to standard preprocessing be presented. 

As mentioned in \secref{stats}
