    \field{abstract}{%
    Chronic pain, one of the most common reasons adults seek medical care (1),
  has been linked to restrictions in mobility and daily activities (2,3),
  dependence on opioids (4), anxiety and depression (2), and poor perceived
  health or reduced quality of life (2,3). Population-based estimates of
  chronic pain among U.S. adults range from 11{\%} to 40{\%} (5), with
  considerable population subgroup variation. As a result, the 2016 National
  Pain Strategy called for more precise prevalence estimates of chronic pain
  and high-impact chronic pain (i.e., chronic pain that frequently limits life
  or work activities) to reliably establish the prevalence of chronic pain and
  aid in the development and implementation of population-wide pain
  interventions (5). National estimates of high-impact chronic pain can help
  differentiate persons with limitations in major life domains, including work,
  social, recreational, and self-care activities from those who maintain normal
  life activities despite chronic pain, providing a better understanding of the
  population in need of pain services. To estimate the prevalence of chronic
  pain and high-impact chronic pain in the United States, CDC analyzed 2016
  National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data. An estimated 20.4{\%} (50.0
  million) of U.S. adults had chronic pain and 8.0{\%} of U.S. adults (19.6
  million) had high-impact chronic pain, with higher prevalences of both
  chronic pain and high-impact chronic pain reported among women, older adults,
  previously but not currently employed adults, adults living in poverty,
  adults with public health insurance, and rural residents. These findings
  could be used to target pain management interventions.%

    The Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health,
  has requested that the IOM (Institute of Medicine) convene the ad hoc
  committee to address the current state of the science with respect to pain
  research, care, and education; and explore approaches to advance the field.
  Specifically, the committee will Review and quantify the public health
  significance of pain, including the adequacy of assessment, diagnosis,
  treatment, and management of acute and chronic pain in the United States.
  This effort will take a comprehensive view of chronic pain as a biological,
  biobehavioral, and societal condition. Identify barriers to appropriate pain
  care and strategies to reduce such barriers, including exploring the
  importance of individualized approaches to diagnosis and treatment of pain.
  Identify demographic groups and special populations, including older adults,
  individuals with co-morbidities, and cognitive impairment, that may be
  disparately undertreated for pain, and discuss related research needs,
  barriers particularly associated with these demographic groups, and
  opportunities to reduce such barriers. Identify and discuss what scientific
  tools and technologies are available, what strategies can be employed to
  enhance training of pain researchers, and what interdisciplinary research
  approaches will be necessary in the short and long term to advance basic,
  translational, and clinical pain research and improve the assessment,
  diagnosis, treatment, and management of pain. Discuss opportunities for
  public–private partnerships in the support and conduct of pain research,
  care, and education.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Large individual differences in pain sensitivity present a challenge for
  medical diagnosis and may be of importance for the development of chronic
  pain. Variance in pain sensitivity is partially mediated by genetic factors,
  but the extent of this contribution is uncertain. We examined cold-pressor
  pain and contact heat pain in 53 identical (MZ) and 39 fraternal (DZ) twin
  pairs, and 4 single twins to determine the heritability of the two
  phenotypes, and the extent to which the same genetic and environmental
  factors affect both pain modalities. An estimated 60{\%} of the variance in
  cold-pressor pain and 26{\%} of the variance in heat pain was genetically
  mediated. Genetic and environmental factors were only moderately correlated
  across pain modalities. Genetic factors common to both modalities explained
  7{\%} of the variance in cold-pressor and 3{\%} of the variance in heat pain.
  Environmental factors common to both modalities explained 5{\%} of variance
  in cold-pressor and 8{\%} of the variance in heat pain. The remaining
  variance was due to factors that were specific to each pain modality. These
  findings demonstrate that cold-pressor pain and contact heat pain are mainly
  distinct phenomena from both a genetic and an environmental standpoint. This
  may partly explain disparate results in genetic association studies and
  argues for caution in generalizing genetic findings from one pain modality to
  another. It also indicates that differences in pain scale usage account for a
  minor portion of the variance, providing strong support for the validity of
  subjective pain ratings as measures of experienced pain. {\textcopyright}

    \field{abstract}{%
    Pain is commonly classified into acute and chronic. Acute pain implies a
  painful condition with a rapid onset or of a short course whereas chronic
  pain is referred to as a painful condition persisting beyond the normal time
  of healing. Transition of acute pain to chronic pain is an observed entity
  associated with enormous burden on the healthcare system. Minimization of
  this transition has been a challenge for decades. Numerous studies have
  investigated different factors that increase susceptibility in transition of
  acute to chronic pain. This article focuses on the basic science and
  pathophysiological changes during pain processing and clinical modalities
  aiming to minimize the risk of transition from acute to chronic pain. Pain
  physiology during acute tissue injury In the periphery Acute tissue insults
  such as heat, cold, chemical or mechanical injury, cause disturbance in
  homeosta-sis, and stimulate the pain receptors, called noci-ceptors.
  Homeostasis can be restored by activation and complex interaction among
  autonomic, endo-crine, immune, and nervous systems. 1 After an injury, a wide
  range of inflammatory mediators are released locally either from damaged
  tissue or by activated mast cells and neutrophils. These media-tors are
  adenosine-5-triphosphate (ATP), bradyki-nin, prostaglandin E2, sodium (Na
  þ), hydrogen (H þ), potassium (K þ), histamine, and serotonin. The
  released substances interact with their corre-sponding receptors located on
  the peripheral noci-ceptive neurones leading to depolarization of cell
  membrane and impulse generation within Ad and C fibres. After tissue injury,
  cyclo-oxygenase-2 enzyme is activated and macrophages release
  pro-inflammatory substances such as interleukin-1B, interleukin-6, nerve
  growth factor, and tumour ne-crosis factor-alpha (TNF-a). Peripheral
  inflamma-tion at the site of tissue injury activates C-fibres, which release
  substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), neurokinin A and nitric
  oxide (NO) in a retrograde fashion called 'neurogenic inflammation'. This
  amplifies the whole process resulting in an 'inflammatory soup'. The end
  result is further activation of 'silent' C fibres with a reduction of pain
  threshold and increased excitability.%

    While a variety of cultural, psychological and physiological factors
  contribute to variability in both clinical and experimental contexts, the
  role of genetic factors in human pain sensitivity is increasingly recognized
  as an important element. This study was performed to evaluate genetic
  influences on variability in human pain sensitivity associated with gender,
  ethnicity and temperament. Pain sensitivity in response to experimental
  painful thermal and cold stimuli was measured with visual analogue scale
  ratings and temperament dimensions of personality were evaluated. Loci in the
  vanilloid receptor subtype 1 gene (TRPV1), $\delta$ opioid receptor subtype 1
  gene (OPRD1) and catechol O-methyltransferase gene (COMT) were genotyped
  using 5′ nuclease assays. A total of 500 normal participants (306 females
  and 194 males) were evaluated. The sample composition was 62.0{\%} European
  American, 17.4{\%} African American, 9.0{\%} Asian American, and 8.6{\%}
  Hispanic, and 3.0{\%} individuals with mixed racial parentage. Female
  European Americans with the TRPV1 Val585Val allele and males with low harm
  avoidance showed longer cold withdrawal times based on the classification and
  regression tree (CART) analysis. CART identified gender, an OPRD1
  polymorphism and temperament dimensions of personality as the primary
  determinants of heat pain sensitivity at 49°C. Our observations demonstrate
  that gender, ethnicity and temperament contribute to individual variation in
  thermal and cold pain sensitivity by interactions with TRPV1 and OPRD1 single
  nucleotide polymorphisms. {\textcopyright} 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V. on

    Clinical pain is a serious public health issue. Treatment of pain-related
  suffering requires knowledge of how pain signals are initially interpreted
  and subsequently transmitted and perpetuated. This review article is one of
  three reviews in this issue of Neuron that address our understanding of the
  pain process and possible solutions to the problem from both cellular- and
  systems-level viewpoints. Our understanding of the neural correlates of pain
  perception in humans has increased significantly since the advent of
  neuroimaging. Relating neural activity changes to the varied pain experiences
  has led to an increased awareness of how factors (e.g., cognition, emotion,
  context, injury) can separately influence pain perception. Tying this body of
  knowledge in humans to work in animal models of pain provides an opportunity
  to determine common features that reliably contribute to pain perception and
  its modulation. One key system that underpins the ability to change pain
  intensity is the brainstem's descending modulatory network with its pro- and
  antinociceptive components. We discuss not only the latest data describing
  the cerebral signature of pain and its modulation in humans, but also suggest
  that the brainstem plays a pivotal role in gating the degree of nociceptive
  transmission so that the resultant pain experienced is appropriate for the
  particular situation of the individual. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

    The nervous system detects and interprets a wide range of thermal and
  mechanical stimuli as well as environmental and endogenous chemical
  irritants. When intense, these stimuli generate acute pain, and in the
  setting of persistent injury, both peripheral and central nervous system
  components of the pain transmission pathway exhibit tremendous plasticity,
  enhancing pain signals and producing hypersensitivity. When plasticity
  facilitates protective reflexes, it can be beneficial, but when the changes
  persist, a chronic pain condition may result. Genetic, electrophysiological,
  and pharmacological studies are elucidating the molecular mechanisms that
  underlie detection, coding, and modulation of noxious stimuli that generate

    Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging
  (fMRI) depicts changes in deoxyhemoglobin concentration consequent to
  task-induced or spontaneous modulation of neural metabolism. Since its
  inception in 1990, this method has been widely employed in thousands of
  studies of cognition for clinical applications such as surgical planning, for
  monitoring treatment outcomes, and as a biomarker in pharmacologic and
  training programs. Technical developments have solved most of the challenges
  of applying fMRI in practice. These challenges include low contrast to noise
  ratio of BOLD signals, image distortion, and signal dropout. More recently,
  attention is turning to the use of pattern classification and other
  statistical methods to draw increasingly complex inferences about cognitive
  brain states from fMRI data. This paper reviews the methods, some of the
  challenges and the future of fMRI.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    This book is a comprehensive and authoritative text on the expanding scope
  of CMR, dedicated to covering basic principles in detail focusing on the
  needs of cardiovascular imagers. The target audience for this book includes
  CMR specialists, trainees in CMR and cardiovascular medicine, cardiovascular
  physicists or clinical cardiovascular imagers. This book includes figures and
  CMR examples in the form of high-resolution still images and is divided in
  two sections: basic MRI physics, i.e. the nuts and bolts of MR imaging; and
  imaging techniques (pulse sequences) used in cardiovascular MR imaging. Each
  imaging technique is discussed in a separate chapter that includes the
  physics and clinical applications (with cardiovascular examples) of a
  particular technique. Evolving techniques or research based techniques are
  discussed as well. This section covers both cardiac and vascular imaging.
  ​Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is now considered a
  clinically important imaging modality for patients with a wide variety of
  cardiovascular diseases. Recent developments in scanner hardware, imaging
  sequences, and analysis software have led to 3-dimensional, high-resolution
  imaging of the cardiovascular system. These developments have also influenced
  a wide variety of cardiovascular imaging applications and it is now routinely
  used in clinical practice in CMR laboratories around the world. The
  non-invasiveness and lack of ionizing radiation exposure make CMR uniquely
  important for patients whose clinical condition requires serial imaging
  follow-up. This is particularly true for patients with congenital heart
  disease (CHD) with or without surgical corrections who require lifelong
  clinical and imaging follow-up.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Functional imaging modalities, such as functional magnetic
  resonance$\backslash$nimaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), are
  rapidly changing$\backslash$nthe scope and practice of neuroradiology. While
  these modalities have$\backslash$nlong been used in research, they are
  increasingly being used in clinical$\backslash$npractice to enable reliable
  identification of eloquent cortex and white$\backslash$nmatter tracts in
  order to guide treatment planning and to serve as a$\backslash$ndiagnostic
  supplement when traditional imaging fails. An understanding$\backslash$nof
  the scientific principles underlying fMRI and DTI is necessary
  in$\backslash$ncurrent radiological practice. fMRI relies on a compensatory
  hemodynamic$\backslash$nresponse seen in cortical activation and the
  intrinsic discrepant$\backslash$nmagnetic properties of deoxy-and
  oxyhemoglobin. Neuronal activity can be$\backslash$nindirectly visualized
  based on a hemodynamic response, termed$\backslash$nneurovascular coupling.
  fMRI demonstrates utility in identifying areas$\backslash$nof cortical
  activation (i.e., task-based activation) and in discerning$\backslash$nareas
  of neuronal connectivity when used during the resting
  state,$\backslash$ntermed resting state fMRI. While fMRI is limited to
  visualization of$\backslash$ngray matter, DTI permits visualization of white
  matter tracts through$\backslash$ndiffusion restriction along different axes.
  We will discuss the$\backslash$nphysical, statistical and physiological
  principles underlying these$\backslash$nfunctional imaging modalities and
  explore new promising clinical$\backslash$napplications.%

    The quantification of blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) functional
  MRI (fMRI) signals is closely related to cerebral blood flow (CBF) change;
  therefore, understanding the exact relationship between BOLD and CBF changes
  on a pixel-by-pixel basis is fundamental. In this study, quantitative CBF
  changes induced by neural activity were used to quantify BOLD signal changes
  during somatosensory stimulation in alpha-chloralose-anesthetized rats. To
  examine the influence of fast-moving vascular spins in quantifying CBF,
  bipolar gradients were employed. Our data show no significant difference in
  relative CBF changes obtained with and without bipolar gradients. To compare
  BOLD and CBF signal changes induced by neural stimulation, a spin-echo (SE)
  sequence with long SE time of 40 ms at 9.4 T was used in conjunction with an
  arterial spin labeling technique. SE BOLD changes were quantitatively
  correlated to CBF changes on a pixel-by-pixel and animal-by-animal basis.
  Thus, SE BOLD-based fMRI at high magnetic fields allows a quantitative
  comparison of functional brain activities across brain regions and subjects.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Many sources of fluctuation contribute to the fMRI signal, and this makes
  identifying the effects that are truly related to the underlying neuronal
  activity difficult. Independent component analysis (ICA) - one of the most
  widely used techniques for the exploratory analysis of fMRI data - has shown
  to be a powerful technique in identifying various sources of
  neuronally-related and artefactual fluctuation in fMRI data (both with the
  application of external stimuli and with the subject "at rest"). ICA
  decomposes fMRI data into patterns of activity (a set of spatial maps and
  their corresponding time series) that are statistically independent and add
  linearly to explain voxel-wise time series. Given the set of ICA components,
  if the components representing "signal" (brain activity) can be distinguished
  form the "noise" components (effects of motion, non-neuronal physiology,
  scanner artefacts and other nuisance sources), the latter can then be removed
  from the data, providing an effective cleanup of structured noise. Manual
  classification of components is labour intensive and requires expertise;
  hence, a fully automatic noise detection algorithm that can reliably detect
  various types of noise sources (in both task and resting fMRI) is desirable.
  In this paper, we introduce FIX ("FMRIB's ICA-based X-noiseifier"), which
  provides an automatic solution for denoising fMRI data via accurate
  classification of ICA components. For each ICA component FIX generates a
  large number of distinct spatial and temporal features, each describing a
  different aspect of the data (e.g., what proportion of temporal fluctuations
  are at high frequencies). The set of features is then fed into a multi-level
  classifier (built around several different classifiers). Once trained through
  the hand-classification of a sufficient number of training datasets, the
  classifier can then automatically classify new datasets. The noise components
  can then be subtracted from (or regressed out of) the original data, to
  provide automated cleanup. On conventional resting-state fMRI (rfMRI)
  single-run datasets, FIX achieved about 95{\%} overall accuracy. On
  high-quality rfMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, FIX achieves over
  99{\%} classification accuracy, and as a result is being used in the default
  rfMRI processing pipeline for generating HCP connectomes. FIX is publicly
  available as a plugin for FSL. {\textcopyright} 2014.%

    Rationale and Objectives. Physiological noise in blood oxygen
  level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) has been
  shown to have characteristics similar to the BOLD signal itself, suggesting
  that it may have a vascular dependence. In this study, we evaluated the
  influence of physiological noise in fMRI as revealed by the differences in
  vasculature sensitivity of gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (GE-EPI) and
  spin-echo EPI (SE-EPI). Materials and Methods. The contribution of
  physiological noise to the fMRI signal during activation of the visual cortex
  was assessed by comparing its temporal characteristics with respect to echo
  time (TE), using both GE-EPI and SE-EPI. The correlation of the noise in fMRI
  with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and the number of components
  required to describe its variance, as determined by principal-component
  analysis (PCA), were also assessed. Results. The SE-EPI data were less
  affected by a TE-dependence of noise, in contrast to the apparent
  physiological noise in GE-EPI. Voxel-wise analysis revealed that total
  apparent noise increased as ADC values increased, and the relationship was
  different for GE-EPI and SE-EPI. PCA revealed that while the number of
  components characterizing the noise in SE-EPI data increased in a
  TE-dependent manner, approaching that of white noise at long echo time, the
  number of components from GE-EPI data was TE-independent. Conclusions. The
  difference in sensitivities to physiological noise between SE-EPI and GE-EPI
  suggests that extravascular BOLD processes around draining veins contribute
  significantly to physiological noise in BOLD fMRI, and the suppression of
  this noise component may enhance SE-EPI BOLD sensitivity at higher fields.

    \field{abstract}{%
    Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is one of the most widely used
  tools to study the neural underpinnings of human cognition. Standard analysis
  of fMRI data relies on a general linear model (GLM) approach to separate
  stimulus induced signals from noise. Crucially, this approach relies on a
  number of assumptions about the data which, for inferences to be valid, must
  be met. The current paper reviews the GLM approach to analysis of fMRI
  time-series, focusing in particular on the degree to which such data abides
  by the assumptions of the GLM framework, and on the methods that have been
  developed to correct for any violation of those assumptions. Rather than
  biasing estimates of effect size, the major consequence of non-conformity to
  the assumptions is to introduce bias into estimates of the variance, thus
  affecting test statistics, power, and false positive rates. Furthermore, this
  bias can have pervasive effects on both individual subject and group-level
  statistics, potentially yielding qualitatively different results across
  replications, especially after the thresholding procedures commonly used for
  inference-making.%

    The Motor-Free Visual Perception Test, revised (MVPT-R), provides a measure
  of visual perceptual processing. It involves different cognitive elements
  including visual discrimination, spatial relationships, and mental rotation.
  We adapted the MVPT-R to an event-related functional MRI (fMRI) environment
  to investigate the brain regions involved in the interrelation of these
  cognitive elements. Two complementary analysis methods were employed to
  characterize the fMRI data: (a) a general linear model SPM approach based
  upon a model of the time course and a hemodynamic response estimate and (b)
  independent component analysis (ICA), which does not constrain the specific
  shape of the time course per se, although we did require it to be at least
  transiently task-related. Additionally, we implemented ICA in a novel way to
  create a group average that was compared with the SPM group results. Both
  methods yielded similar, but not identical, results and detected a network of
  robustly activated visual, inferior parietal, and frontal eye-field areas as
  well as thalamus and cerebellum. SPM appeared to be the more sensitive method
  and has a well-developed theoretical approach to thresholding. The ICA method
  segregated functional elements into separate maps and identified additional
  regions with extended activation in response to presented events. The results
  demonstrate the utility of complementary analyses for fMRI data and suggest
  that the cerebellum may play a significant role in visual perceptual
  processing. Additionally, results illustrate functional connectivity between
  frontal eye fields and prefrontal and parietal regions. {\textcopyright} 2001

    Multiple studies have found neurofunctional changes in normal aging in a
  context of selective attention. Furthermore, many articles report
  intrahemispheric alteration in functional networks. However, little is known
  about age-related changes within the Ventral Attention Network (VAN), which
  underlies selective attention. The aim of this study is to examine
  age-related changes within the VAN, focusing on connectivity between its
  regions. Here we report our findings on the analysis of 27 participants' (13
  younger and 14 older healthy adults) BOLD signals as well as their
  performance on a letter-matching task. We identified the VAN independently
  for both groups using spatial independent component analysis. Three main
  findings emerged: First, younger adults were faster and more accurate on the
  task. Second, older adults had greater connectivity among posterior regions
  (right temporoparietal junction, right superior parietal lobule, right middle
  temporal gyrus and left cerebellum crus I) than younger adults but lower
  connectivity among anterior regions (right anterior insula, right medial
  superior frontal gyrus and right middle frontal gyrus). Older adults also had
  more connectivity between anterior and posterior regions than younger adults.
  Finally, correlations between connectivity and response time on the task
  showed a trend toward connectivity in posterior regions for the older group
  and in anterior regions for the younger group. Thus, this study shows that
  intrahemispheric neurofunctional changes in aging also affect the VAN. The
  results suggest that, in contexts of selective attention, posterior regions
  increased in importance for older adults, while anterior regions had reduced
  centrality.%

    Estimates of functional connectivity derived from resting-state functional
  magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) are sensitive to artefacts caused by
  in-scanner head motion. This susceptibility has motivated the development of
  numerous denoising methods designed to mitigate motion-related artefacts.
  Here, we compare popular retrospective rs-fMRI denoising methods, such as
  regression of head motion parameters and mean white matter (WM) and
  cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (with and without expansion terms), aCompCor,
  volume censoring (e.g., scrubbing and spike regression), global signal
  regression and ICA-AROMA, combined into 19 different pipelines. These
  pipelines were evaluated across five different quality control benchmarks in
  four independent datasets associated with varying levels of motion. Pipelines
  were benchmarked by examining the residual relationship between in-scanner
  movement and functional connectivity after denoising; the effect of distance
  on this residual relationship; whole-brain differences in functional
  connectivity between high- and low-motion healthy controls (HC); the temporal
  degrees of freedom lost during denoising; and the test-retest reliability of
  functional connectivity estimates. We also compared the sensitivity of each
  pipeline to clinical differences in functional connectivity in independent
  samples of people with schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Our
  results indicate that (1) simple linear regression of regional fMRI time
  series against head motion parameters and WM/CSF signals (with or without
  expansion terms) is not sufficient to remove head motion artefacts; (2)
  aCompCor pipelines may only be viable in low-motion data; (3) volume
  censoring performs well at minimising motion-related artefact but a major
  benefit of this approach derives from the exclusion of high-motion
  individuals; (4) while not as effective as volume censoring, ICA-AROMA
  performed well across our benchmarks for relatively low cost in terms of data
  loss; (5) the addition of global signal regression improved the performance
  of nearly all pipelines on most benchmarks, but exacerbated the
  distance-dependence of correlations between motion and functional
  connectivity; and (6) group comparisons in functional connectivity between
  healthy controls and schizophrenia patients are highly dependent on
  preprocessing strategy. We offer some recommendations for best practice and
  outline simple analyses to facilitate transparent reporting of the degree to
  which a given set of findings may be affected by motion-related artefact.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Although individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis exhibit a
  psychosis-risk syndrome involving attenuated forms of the positive symptoms
  typical of schizophrenia (SZ), it remains unclear whether their resting-state
  brain intrinsic functional networks (INs) show attenuated or qualitatively
  distinct patterns of functional dysconnectivity relative to SZ patients.
  Based on resting-state functional magnetic imaging data from 70 healthy
  controls (HCs), 53 CHR individuals (among which 41 subjects were
  antipsychotic medication-naive), and 58 early illness SZ (ESZ) patients
  (among which 53 patients took antipsychotic medication) within five years of
  illness onset, we estimated subject-specific INs using a novel group
  information guided independent component analysis (GIG-ICA) and investigated
  group differences in INs. We found that when compared to HCs, both CHR and
  ESZ groups showed significant differences, primarily in default mode,
  salience, auditory-related, visuospatial, sensory-motor, and parietal INs.
  Our findings suggest that widespread INs were diversely impacted. More than
  25{\%} of voxels in the identified significant discriminative regions
  (obtained using all 19 possible changing patterns excepting the no-difference
  pattern) from six of the 15 interrogated INs exhibited monotonically
  decreasing Z-scores (in INs) from the HC to CHR to ESZ, and the related
  regions included the left lingual gyrus of two vision-related networks, the
  right postcentral cortex of the visuospatial network, the left thalamus
  region of the salience network, the left calcarine region of the
  fronto-occipital network and fronto-parieto-occipital network. Compared to
  HCs and CHR individuals, ESZ patients showed both increasing and decreasing
  connectivity, mainly hypo-connectivity involving 15{\%} of the altered voxels
  from four INs. The left supplementary motor area from the sensory-motor
  network and the right inferior occipital gyrus in the vision-related network
  showed a common abnormality in CHR and ESZ groups. Some brain regions also
  showed a CHR-unique alteration (primarily the CHR-increasing connectivity).
  In summary, CHR individuals generally showed intermediate connectivity
  between HCs and ESZ patients across multiple INs, suggesting that some
  dysconnectivity patterns evident in ESZ predate psychosis in attenuated form
  during the psychosis risk stage. Hence, these connectivity measures may serve
  as possible biomarkers to predict schizophrenia progression.%

    Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals in functional magnetic
  resonance imaging (fMRI) are often small compared to the level of noise in
  the data. The sources of noise are numerous including different kinds of
  motion artifacts and physiological noise with complex patterns. This
  complicates the statistical analysis of the fMRI data. In this study, we
  propose an automatic method to reduce fMRI artifacts based on independent
  component analysis (ICA). We trained a supervised classifier to distinguish
  between independent components relating to a potentially task-related signal
  and independent components clearly relating to structured noise. After the
  components had been classified as either signal or noise, a denoised fMR
  time-series was reconstructed based only on the independent components
  classified as potentially task-related. The classifier was a novel global
  (fixed structure) decision tree trained in a Neyman-Pearson (NP) framework,
  which allowed the shape of the decision regions to be controlled effectively.
  Additionally, the conservativeness of the classifier could be tuned by
  modifying the NP threshold. The classifier was tested against the component
  classifications by an expert with the data from a category learning task. The
  test set as well as the expert were different from the data used for
  classifier training and the expert labeling the training set. The
  misclassification rate was between 0.2 and 0.3 for both the event-related and
  blocked designs and it was consistent among variety of different NP
  thresholds. The effects of denoising on the group-level statistical analyses
  were as expected: The denoising generally decreased Z-scores in the white
  matter, where extreme Z-values can be expected to reflect artifacts. A
  similar but weaker decrease in Z-scores was observed in the gray matter on
  average. These two observations suggest that denoising was likely to reduce
  artifacts from gray matter and could be useful to improve the detection of
  activations. We conclude that automatic ICA-based denoising offers a
  potentially useful approach to improve the quality of fMRI data and
  consequently increase the accuracy of the statistical analysis of these data.

    We present a practical “how-to” guide to help determine whether
  single-subject fMRI independent components (ICs) characterise structured
  noise or not. Manual identification of signal and noise after ICA
  decomposition is required for efficient data denoising: to train supervised
  algorithms, to check the results of unsupervised ones or to manually clean
  the data. In this paper we describe the main spatial and temporal features of
  ICs and provide general guidelines on how to evaluate these. Examples of
  signal and noise components are provided from a wide range of datasets (3T
  data, including examples from the UK Biobank and the Human Connectome
  Project, and 7T data), together with practical guidelines for their
  identification. Finally, we discuss how the data quality, data type and
  preprocessing can influence the characteristics of the ICs and present
  examples of particularly challenging datasets.%

    An automated method for segmenting magnetic resonance head images into
  brain and non-brain has been developed. It is very robust and accurate and
  has been tested on thousands of data sets from a wide variety of scanners and
  taken with a wide variety of MR sequences. The method, Brain Extraction Tool
  (BET), uses a deformable model that evolves to fit the brain's surface by the
  application of a set of locally adaptive model forces. The method is very
  fast and requires no preregistration or other pre-processing before being
  applied. We describe the new method and give examples of results and the

    Registration is an important component of medical image analysis and for
  analysing large amounts of data it is desirable to have fully automatic
  registration methods. Many different automatic registration methods have been
  proposed to date, and almost all share a common mathematical framework - one
  of optimising a cost function. To date little attention has been focused on
  the optimisation method itself, even though the success of most registration
  methods hinges on the quality of this optimisation. This paper examines the
  assumptions underlying the problem of registration for brain images using
  inter-modal voxel similarity measures. It is demonstrated that the use of
  local optimisation methods together with the standard multi-resolution
  approach is not sufficient to reliably find the global minimum. To address
  this problem, a global optimisation method is proposed that is specifically
  tailored to this form of registration. A full discussion of all the necessary
  implementation details is included as this is an important part of any
  practical method. Furthermore, results are presented for inter-modal,
  inter-subject registration experiments that show that the proposed method is
  more reliable at finding the global minimum than several of the currently
  available registration packages in common usage. {\textcopyright} 2001

    Human pain neuroimaging has exploded in the past 2 decades. During this
  time, the broader neuroimaging community has continued to investigate and
  refine methods. Another key to progress is exchange with clinicians and pain
  scientists working with other model systems and approaches. These
  collaborative efforts require that non-imagers be able to evaluate and assess
  the evidence provided in these reports. Likewise, new trainees must design
  rigorous and reliable pain imaging experiments. In this article we provide a
  guideline for designing, reading, evaluating, analyzing, and reporting
  results of a pain neuroimaging experiment, with a focus on functional and
  structural magnetic resonance imaging. We focus in particular on
  considerations that are unique to neuroimaging studies of pain in humans,
  including study design and analysis, inferences that can be drawn from these
  studies, and the strengths and limitations of the approach. Perspective: This
  article provides an overview of the concepts and considerations of structural
  and functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging studies. The primer is written
  for those who are not familiar with brain imaging. We review key concepts
  related to recruitment and study sample, experimental design, data analysis
  and data interpretation.%

    Linear registration and motion correction are important components of
  structural and functional brain image analysis. Most modern methods optimize
  some intensity-based cost function to determine the best registration. To
  date, little attention has been focused on the optimization method itself,
  even though the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of
  this optimization. This paper examines the optimization process in detail and
  demonstrates that the commonly used multiresolution local optimization
  methods can, and do, get trapped in local minima. To address this problem,
  two approaches are taken: (1) to apodize the cost function and (2) to employ
  a novel hybrid global-local optimization method. This new optimization method
  is specifically designed for registering whole brain images. It substantially
  reduces the likelihood of producing misregistrations due to being trapped by
  local minima. The increased robustness of the method, compared to other
  commonly used methods, is demonstrated by a consistency test. In addition,
  the accuracy of the registration is demonstrated by a series of experiments
  with motion correction. These motion correction experiments also investigate
  how the results are affected by different cost functions and interpolation
  methods. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).%

    This paper describes a new approach to low level image processing; in
  particular, edge and corner detection and structure preserving noise
  reduction. Non-linear filtering is used to define which parts of the image
  are closely related to each individual pixel; each pixel has associated with
  it a local image region which is of similar brightness to that pixel. The new
  feature detectors are based on the minimization of this local image region,
  and the noise reduction method uses this region as the smoothing
  neighbourhood. The resulting methods are accurate, noise resistant and fast.
  Details of the new feature detectors and of the new noise reduction method

    We present an integrated approach to probabilistic independent component
  analysis (ICA) for functional MRI (FMRI) data that allows for nonsquare
  mixing in the presence of Gaussian noise. In order to avoid overfitting, we
  employ objective estimation of the amount of Gaussian noise through Bayesian
  analysis of the true dimensionality of the data, i.e., the number of
  activation and non-Gaussian noise sources. This enables us to carry out
  probabilistic modeling and achieves an asymptotically unique decomposition of
  the data. It reduces problems of interpretation, as each final independent
  component is now much more likely to be due to only one physical or
  physiological process. We also describe other improvements to standard ICA,
  such as temporal prewhitening and variance normalization of timeseries, the
  latter being particularly useful in the context of dimensionality reduction
  when weak activation is present. We discuss the use of prior information
  about the spatiotemporal nature of the source processes, and an
  alternative-hypothesis testing approach for inference, using Gaussian mixture
  models. The performance of our approach is illustrated and evaluated on real
  and artificial FMRI data, and compared to the spatio-temporal accuracy of
  results obtained from classical ICA and GLM analyses.%

    Multivariate analysis methods such as independent component analysis (ICA)
  have been applied to the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging
  (fMRI) data to study brain function. Because of the high dimensionality and
  high noise level of the fMRI data, order selection, i.e., estimation of the
  number of informative components, is critical to reduce over/underfitting in
  such methods. Dependence among fMRI data samples in the spatial and temporal
  domain limits the usefulness of the practical formulations of
  information-theoretic criteria (ITC) for order selection, since they are
  based on likelihood of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data
  samples. To address this issue, we propose a subsampling scheme to obtain a
  set of effectively i.i.d. samples from the dependent data samples and apply
  the ITC formulas to the effectively i.i.d. sample set for order selection. We
  apply the proposed method on the simulated data and show that it
  significantly improves the accuracy of order selection from dependent data.
  We also perform order selection on fMRI data from a visuomotor task and show
  that the proposed method alleviates the over-estimation on the number of
  brain sources due to the intrinsic smoothness and the smooth preprocessing of
  fMRI data. We use the software package ICASSO (Himberg et al. [ 2004]:
  Neuroimage 22:1214–1222) to analyze the independent component (IC)
  estimates at different orders and show that, when ICA is performed at
  overestimated orders, the stability of the IC estimates decreases and the
  estimation of task related brain activations show degradation. Hum Brain

    Independent component analysis (ICA) has been successfully utilized for
  analysis of functional MRI (fMRI) data for task related as well as resting
  state studies. Although it holds the promise of becoming an unbiased
  data-driven analysis technique, a few choices have to be made prior to
  performing ICA, selection of a method for determining the number of
  independent components (nIC) being one of them. Choice of nIC has been shown
  to influence the ICA maps, and various approaches (mostly relying on
  information theoretic criteria) have been proposed and implemented in
  commonly used ICA analysis packages, such as MELODIC and GIFT. However, there
  has been no consensus on the optimal method for nIC selection, and many
  studies utilize arbitrarily chosen values for nIC. Accurate and reliable
  determination of true nIC is especially important in the setting where the
  signals of interest contribute only a small fraction of the total variance,
  i.e. very low contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and/or very focal response. In
  this study, we evaluate the performance of different model order selection
  criteria and demonstrate that the model order selected based upon bootstrap
  stability of principal components yields more reliable and accurate estimates
  of model order. We then demonstrate the utility of this fully data-driven
  approach to detect weak and focal stimulus-driven responses in real data.
  Finally, we compare the performance of different multi-run ICA approaches
  using pseudo-real data.%

    Independent component analysis (ICA) is a technique that attempts to
  separate data into maximally independent groups. Achieving maximal
  independence in space or time yields two varieties of ICA meaningful for
  functional MRI (fMRI) applications: spatial ICA (SICA) and temporal ICA
  (TICA). SICA has so far dominated the application of ICA to fMRI. The
  objective of these experiments was to study ICA with two predictable
  components present and evaluate the importance of the underlying independence
  assumption in the application of ICA. Four novel visual activation paradigms
  were designed, each consisting of two spatiotemporal components that were
  either spatially dependent, temporally dependent, both spatially and
  temporally dependent, or spatially and temporally uncorrelated, respectively.
  Simulated data were generated and fMRI data from six subjects were acquired
  using these paradigms. Data from each paradigm were analyzed with regression
  analysis in order to determine if the signal was occurring as expected.
  Spatial and temporal ICA were then applied to these data, with the general
  result that ICA found components only where expected, e.g., S(T)ICA "failed"
  (i.e., yielded independent components unrelated to the "self-evident"
  components) for paradigms that were spatially (temporally) dependent, and
  "worked" otherwise. Regression analysis proved a useful "check" for these
  data, however strong hypotheses will not always be available, and a strength
  of ICA is that it can characterize data without making specific modeling
  assumptions. We report a careful examination of some of the assumptions
  behind ICA methodologies, provide examples of when applying ICA would provide
  difficult-to-interpret results, and offer suggestions for applying ICA to
  fMRI data especially when more than one task-related component is present in
  the data.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Recent functional brain connectivity studies have contributed to our
  understanding of the neurocircuitry supporting pain perception. However,
  evoked-pain connectivity studies have employed cutaneous and/or brief
  stimuli, which induce sensations that differ appreciably from the clinical
  pain experience. Sustained myofascial pain evoked by pressure cuff affords an
  excellent opportunity to evaluate functional connectivity change to more
  clinically relevant sustained deep-tissue pain. Connectivity in specific
  networks known to be modulated by evoked pain (sensorimotor, salience, dorsal
  attention, frontoparietal control, and default mode networks: SMN, SLN, DAN,
  FCN, and DMN) was evaluated with functional-connectivity magnetic resonance
  imaging, both at rest and during a sustained (6-minute) pain state in healthy
  adults. We found that pain was stable, with no significant changes of
  subjects' pain ratings over the stimulation period. Sustained pain reduced
  connectivity between the SMN and the contralateral leg primary sensorimotor
  (S1/M1) representation. Such SMN-S1/M1 connectivity decreases were also
  accompanied by and correlated with increased SLN-S1/M1 connectivity,
  suggesting recruitment of activated S1/M1 from SMN to SLN. Sustained pain
  also increased DAN connectivity to pain processing regions such as
  mid-cingulate cortex, posterior insula, and putamen. Moreover, greater
  connectivity during pain between contralateral S1/M1 and posterior insula,
  thalamus, putamen, and amygdala was associated with lower cuff pressures
  needed to reach the targeted pain sensation. These results demonstrate that
  sustained pain disrupts resting S1/M1 connectivity by shifting it to a
  network known to process stimulus salience. Furthermore, increased
  connectivity between S1/M1 and both sensory and affective processing areas
  may be an important contribution to interindividual differences in pain
  sensitivity. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Association for the Study of

    We previously discovered that when faced with a challenging cognitive task
  in the context of pain, some people prioritize task performance, while in
  others, pain results in poorer performance. These behaviours, designated
  respectively as A- and P-types (for attention dominates vs pain dominates),
  may reflect pain coping strategies, resilience or vulnerabilities to develop
  chronic pain, or predict the efficacy of treatments such as cognitive
  behavioural therapy. Here, we used a cognitive interference task and pain
  stimulation in 80 subjects to interrogate psychophysical, psychological,
  brain structure and function that distinguish these behavioural strategies.
  During concurrent pain, the A group exhibited faster task reaction times
  (RTs) compared to nonpain trials, whereas the P group had slower RTs during
  pain compared to nonpain trials, with the A group being 143 ms faster than
  the P group. Brain imaging revealed structural and functional brain features
  that characterized these behavioural strategies. Compared to the
  performance-oriented A group, the P group had (1) more gray matter in regions
  implicated in pain and salience (anterior insula, anterior midcingulate
  cortex, supplementary motor area, orbitofrontal cortex, thalamus, caudate),
  (2) greater functional connectivity in sensorimotor and salience
  resting-state networks, (3) less white matter integrity in the internal and
  external capsule, anterior thalamic radiation and corticospinal tract, but
  (4) were indistinguishable based on sex, pain sensitivity, neuroticism, and
  pain catastrophizing. These data may represent neural underpinnings of how
  task performance vs pain is prioritized and provide a framework for
  developing personalized pain therapy approaches that are based on
  behaviour-structure-function organization. {\textcopyright} 2013

    Abstract This book provides an introduction to the principles of several of
  the more widely used methods in medical imaging. Intended for engineering
  students, it provides a final-year undergraduate- or graduate-level
  introduction to several imaging modalities, including MRI, ultrasound, and
  X-Ray CT. The emphasis of the text is on mathematical models for imaging and
  image reconstruction physics. Emphasis is also given to sources of imaging
  artefacts. Such topics are usually not addressed across the different imaging
  modalities in one book, and this is a notable strength of the treatment given
  here. Table of Contents: Introduction / Diagnostic X-Ray Imaging / X-Ray CT /

    T2* relaxation refers to decay of transverse magnetization caused by a
  combination of spin-spin relaxation and magnetic field inhomogeneity. T2*
  relaxation is seen only with gradient-echo (GRE) imaging because transverse
  relaxation caused by magnetic field inhomogeneities is eliminated by the 180
  degrees pulse at spin-echo imaging. T2* relaxation is one of the main
  determinants of image contrast with GRE sequences and forms the basis for
  many magnetic resonance (MR) applications, such as susceptibility-weighted
  (SW) imaging, perfusion MR imaging, and functional MR imaging. GRE sequences
  can be made predominantly T2* weighted by using a low flip angle, long echo
  time, and long repetition time. GRE sequences with T2*-based contrast are
  used to depict hemorrhage, calcification, and iron deposition in various
  tissues and lesions. SW imaging uses phase information in addition to
  T2*-based contrast to exploit the magnetic susceptibility differences of the
  blood and of iron and calcification in various tissues. Perfusion MR imaging
  exploits the signal intensity decrease that occurs with the passage of a high
  concentration of gadopentetate dimeglumine through the microvasculature.
  Change in oxygen saturation during specific tasks changes the local T2*,
  which leads to the blood oxygen level-dependent effect seen at functional MR
  imaging. The basics of T2* relaxation, T2*-weighted sequences, and their
  clinical applications are presented, followed by the principles, techniques,
  and clinical uses of four T2*-based applications, including SW imaging,
  perfusion MR imaging, functional MR imaging, and iron overload imaging%

    Printed word frequency can modulate retrieval effort in a task requiring
  associative semantic judgment. Event-related fMRI, while avoiding stimulus
  order predictability, is in theory statistically less powerful than block
  designs. We compared one event-related and two block designs that evaluated
  the same semantic judgment task and found that similar brain regions
  demonstrated the word frequency effect. Although the responses were lower in
  amplitude, event-related fMRI was able to detect the word frequency effect to
  a comparable degree compared to the block designs. The detection of a
  frequency effect with the event-related design also suggests that
  stimulus-order predictability may not be as serious a concern in block
  designs as might be supposed.%

    A fundamental problem in neural network research, as well as in many other
  disciplines, is finding a suitable representation of multivariate data, i.e.
  random vectors. For reasons of computational and conceptual simplicity, the
  representation is often sought as a linear transformation of the original
  data. In other words, each component of the representation is a linear
  combination of the original variables. Well-known linear transformation
  methods include principal component analysis, factor analysis, and projection
  pursuit. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a recently developed method
  in which the goal is to find a linear representation of non-Gaussian data so
  that the components are statistically independent, or as independent as
  possible. Such a representation seems to capture the essential structure of
  the data in many applications, including feature extraction and signal
  separation. In this paper, we present the basic theory and applications of
  ICA, and our recent work on the subject.%

    In this review, we first set out the general linear model (GLM) for the non
  technical reader, as a tool able to do both linear regression and ANOVA
  within the same flexible framework. We present a short history of its
  development in the fMRI community, and describe some interesting examples of
  its early use. We offer a few warnings, as the GLM relies on assumptions that
  may not hold in all situations. We conclude with a few wishes for the future
  of fMRI analyses, with or without the GLM. The appendix develops some aspects
  of use of contrasts for testing for the more technical reader.
