abstract = {Functional imaging techniques have allowed researchers to look within the brain, and revealed the cortical representation of pain. Initial experiments, performed in the early 1990s, revolutionized pain research, as they demonstrated that pain was not processed in a single cortical area, but in several distributed brain regions. Over the last decade, the roles of these pain centres have been investigated and a clearer picture has emerged of the medial and lateral pain system. In this brief article, we review the imaging literature to date that has allowed these advances to be made, and examine the new frontiers for pain imaging research: imaging the brainstem and other structures involved in the descending control of pain; functional and anatomical connectivity studies of pain processing brain regions; imaging models of neuropathic pain-like states; and going beyond the brain to image spinal function. The ultimate goal of such research is to take these new techniques into the clinic, to investigate and provide new remedies for chronic pain sufferers.},

abstract = {Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) depicts changes in deoxyhemoglobin concentration consequent to task-induced or spontaneous modulation of neural metabolism. Since its inception in 1990, this method has been widely employed in thousands of studies of cognition for clinical applications such as surgical planning, for monitoring treatment outcomes, and as a biomarker in pharmacologic and training programs. Technical developments have solved most of the challenges of applying fMRI in practice. These challenges include low contrast to noise ratio of BOLD signals, image distortion, and signal dropout. More recently, attention is turning to the use of pattern classification and other statistical methods to draw increasingly complex inferences about cognitive brain states from fMRI data. This paper reviews the methods, some of the challenges and the future of fMRI.},

abstract = {Functional neuroimaging studies suggest that the anterior, mid, and posterior division of the insula subserve different functions in the perception of pain. The anterior insula (AI) has predominantly been associated with cognitive-affective aspects of pain, while the mid and posterior divisions have been implicated in sensory-discriminative processing. We examined whether this functional segregation is paralleled by differences in (1) structural and (2) resting state connectivity and (3) in correlations with pain-relevant psychological traits. Analyses were restricted to the 3 insular subdivisions and other pain-related brain regions. Both type of analyses revealed largely overlapping results. The AI division was predominantly connected to the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (structural and resting state connectivity) and orbitofrontal cortex (structural connectivity). In contrast, the posterior insula showed strong connections to the primary somatosensory cortex (SI; structural connectivity) and secondary somatosensory cortex (SII; structural and resting state connectivity). The mid insula displayed a hybrid connectivity pattern with strong connections with the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, SII (structural and resting state connectivity) and SI (structural connectivity). Moreover, resting state connectivity revealed strong connectivity of all 3 subdivisions with the thalamus. On the behavioural level, AI structural connectivity was related to the individual degree of pain vigilance and awareness that showed a positive correlation with AI-amygdala connectivity and a negative correlation with AI-rostral anterior cingulate cortex connectivity. In sum, our findings show a differential structural and resting state connectivity for the anterior, mid, and posterior insula with other pain-relevant brain regions, which might at least partly explain their different functional profiles in pain processing.},

However, our understanding of their anatomical connectivities is relatively weak. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a magnetic resonance imaging-based method, allows in vivo mapping of the anatomical connections in the human brain and was used to investigate the white matter connections originating from the periaquaductal grey (PAG) and nucleus cuneiformis (NCF). We performed DTI on 8 healthy right-handed male volunteers. Group analysis showed that tract paths could be defined and their likelihood quantified for connections between the PAG and separately for the NCF, to the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, thalamus, hypothalamus and rostroventral medial medulla bilaterally. The connections identified confirm the existence of an anatomical circuitry for the functionally characterised top-down influences on pain processing via brainstem structures in humans. {\textcopyright} 2006 International Association for the Study of Pain.},

abstract = {Recent studies have illustrated that motion-related artifacts remain in resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data even after common corrective processing procedures have been applied, but the extent to which head motion distorts the data may be modulated by the corrective approach taken. We compare two different methods for estimating nuisance signals from tissues not expected to exhibit BOLD fMRI signals of neuronal origin: 1) the more commonly used mean signal method and 2) the principal components analysis approach (aCompCor: Behzadi et al., 2007). Further, we investigate the added benefit of "scrubbing" (Power et al., 2012) following both methods. We demonstrate that the use of aCompCor removes motion artifacts more effectively than tissue-mean signal regression. In addition, inclusion of more components from anatomically defined regions of no interest better mitigates motion-related artifacts and improves the specificity of functional connectivity estimates. While scrubbing further attenuates motion-related artifacts when mean signals are used, scrubbing provides no additional benefit in terms of motion artifact reduction or connectivity specificity when using aCompCor. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Gavrilescu2008,
abstract = {A number of techniques have been used to provide functional connectivity estimates for a given fMRI data set. In this study we compared two methods: a 'rest-like' method where the functional connectivity was estimated for the whitened residuals after regressing out the task-induced effects, and a within-condition method where the functional connectivity was estimated separately for each experimental condition. In both cases four pre-processing strategies were used: 1) time courses extracted from standard pre-processed data (standard); 2) adjusted time courses extracted using the volume of interest routines in SPM2 from standard pre-processed data (spm); 3) time courses extracted from ICA denoised data (standard denoised); and 4) adjusted time courses extracted from ICA denoised data (spm denoised). The temporal correlation between time series extracted from two cortical regions were statistically compared with the temporal correlation between a time series extracted from a cortical region and a time series extracted form a region placed in CSF. Since the later correlation is due to physiological noise and other artifacts, we used this comparison to investigate whether rest-like and task modulated connectivity could be estimated from the same data set. The pre-processing strategy had a significant effect on the connectivity estimates with the standard time courses providing larger connectivity values than the spm time courses for both estimation methods. The CSF comparison indicated that for our data set only rest-like connectivity could be estimated. The rest-like connectivity values were similar with connectivity estimated from resting state data.},

@article{Griffanti2014,
abstract = {The identification of resting state networks (RSNs) and the quantification of their functional connectivity in resting-state fMRI (rfMRI) are seriously hindered by the presence of artefacts, many of which overlap spatially or spectrally with RSNs. Moreover, recent developments in fMRI acquisition yield data with higher spatial and temporal resolutions, but may increase artefacts both spatially and/or temporally. Hence the correct identification and removal of non-neural fluctuations is crucial, especially in accelerated acquisitions. In this paper we investigate the effectiveness of three data-driven cleaning procedures, compare standard against higher (spatial and temporal) resolution accelerated fMRI acquisitions, and investigate the combined effect of different acquisitions and different cleanup approaches. We applied single-subject independent component analysis (ICA), followed by automatic component classification with FMRIB's ICA-based X-noiseifier (FIX) to identify artefactual components. We then compared two first-level (within-subject) cleaning approaches for removing those artefacts and motion-related fluctuations from the data. The effectiveness of the cleaning procedures was assessed using time series (amplitude and spectra), network matrix and spatial map analyses. For time series and network analyses we also tested the effect of a second-level cleaning (informed by group-level analysis). Comparing these approaches, the preferable balance between noise removal and signal loss was achieved by regressing out of the data the full space of motion-related fluctuations and only the unique variance of the artefactual ICA components. Using similar analyses, we also investigated the effects of different cleaning approaches on data from different acquisition sequences. With the optimal cleaning procedures, functional connectivity results from accelerated data were statistically comparable or significantly better than the standard (unaccelerated) acquisition, and, crucially, with higher spatial and temporal resolution. Moreover, we were able to perform higher dimensionality ICA decompositions with the accelerated data, which is very valuable for detailed network analyses. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

FC has been evaluated both during task performance and in the "resting" state, yielding reports of FC differences correlated with behavior and diagnosis. Two methodologies are widely used for evaluating FC from blood oxygenation level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging data: Temporal correlation with a specified seed voxel or small region of interest; and spatial independent component analysis. While results from seed-based and independent component analysis methodologies are generally similar, they are conceptually different. This study is intended to elucidate and illustrate, qualitatively and quantitatively, the relationship between seed and independent component analysis derived measures of FC. Seed-based FC measures are shown to be the sum of independent component analysis-derived within network connectivities and between network connectivities.

abstract = {Neuronal dynamics unfolding within the cerebral cortex exhibit complex spatial and temporal patterns even in the absence of external input. Here we use a computational approach in an attempt to relate these features of spontaneous cortical dynamics to the underlying anatomical connectivity. Simulating nonlinear neuronal dynamics on a network that captures the large-scale interregional connections of macaque neocortex, and applying information theoretic measures to identify functional networks, we find structure-function relations at multiple temporal scales. Functional networks recovered from long windows of neural activity (minutes) largely overlap with the underlying structural network. As a result, hubs in these long-run functional networks correspond to structural hubs. In contrast, significant fluctuations in functional topology are observed across the sequence of networks recovered from consecutive shorter (seconds) time windows. The functional centrality of individual nodes varies across time as interregional couplings shift. Furthermore, the transient couplings between brain regions are coordinated in a manner that reveals the existence of two anticorrelated clusters. These clusters are linked by prefrontal and parietal regions that are hub nodes in the underlying structural network. At an even faster time scale (hundreds of milliseconds) we detect individual episodes of interregional phase-locking and find that slow variations in the statistics of these transient episodes, contingent on the underlying anatomical structure, produce the transfer entropy functional connectivity and simulated blood oxygenation level-dependent correlation patterns observed on slower time scales.},

abstract = {In the cerebral cortex, the activity levels of neuronal populations are continuously fluctuating. When neuronal activity, as measured using functional MRI (fMRI), is temporally coherent across 2 populations, those populations are said to be functionally connected. Functional connectivity has previously been shown to correlate with structural (anatomical) connectivity patterns at an aggregate level. In the present study we investigate, with the aid of computational modeling, whether systems-level properties of functional networks--including their spatial statistics and their persistence across time--can be accounted for by properties of the underlying anatomical network. We measured resting state functional connectivity (using fMRI) and structural connectivity (using diffusion spectrum imaging tractography) in the same individuals at high resolution. Structural connectivity then provided the couplings for a model of macroscopic cortical dynamics. In both model and data, we observed (i) that strong functional connections commonly exist between regions with no direct structural connection, rendering the inference of structural connectivity from functional connectivity impractical; (ii) that indirect connections and interregional distance accounted for some of the variance in functional connectivity that was unexplained by direct structural connectivity; and (iii) that resting-state functional connectivity exhibits variability within and across both scanning sessions and model runs. These empirical and modeling results demonstrate that although resting state functional connectivity is variable and is frequently present between regions without direct structural linkage, its strength, persistence, and spatial statistics are nevertheless constrained by the large-scale anatomical structure of the human cerebral cortex.},

abstract = {Localized changes in cortical blood oxygenation during voluntary movements were examined with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and evaluated with a new dynamical cluster analysis (DCA) method. fMRI was performed during finger movements with eight subjects on a 1.5-T scanner using single-slice echo planar imaging with a 107-ms repetition time. Clustering based on similarity of the detailed signal time courses requires besides the used distance measure no assumptions about spatial location and extension of activation sites or the shape of the expected activation time course. We discuss the basic requirements on a clustering algorithm for fMRI data. It is shown that with respect to easy adjustment of the quantization error and reproducibility of the results DCA outperforms the standard k-means algorithm. In contrast to currently used clustering methods for fMRI, like k-means or fuzzy k-means, DCA extracts the appropriate number and initial shapes of representative signal time courses from data properties during run time. With DCA we simultaneously calculate a two-dimensional projection of cluster centers (MDS) and data points for online visualization of the results. We describe the new DCA method and show for the well-studied motor task that it detects cortical activation loci and provides additional information by discriminating different shapes and phases of hemodynamic responses. Robustness of activity detection is demonstrated with respect to repeated DCA runs and effects of different data preprocessing are shown. As an example of how DCA enables further analysis we examined activation onset times. In areas SMA, M1, and S1 simultaneous and sequential activation (in the given order) was found.},

abstract = {Principles from multidimensional NMR spectroscopy, and in particular solid-state NMR, have recently been transferred to the field of diffusion MRI, offering non-invasive characterization of heterogeneous anisotropic materials, such as the human brain, at an unprecedented level of detail. Here we revisit the basic physics of solid-state NMR and diffusion MRI to pinpoint the origin of the somewhat unexpected analogy between the two fields, and provide an overview of current diffusion MRI acquisition protocols and data analysis methods to quantify the composition of heterogeneous materials in terms of diffusion tensor distributions with size, shape, and orientation dimensions. While the most advanced methods allow estimation of the complete multidimensional distributions, simpler methods focus on various projections onto lower-dimensional spaces as well as determination of means and variances rather than actual distributions. Even the less advanced methods provide simple and intuitive scalar parameters that are directly related to microstructural features that can be observed in optical microscopy images, e.g. average cell eccentricity, variance of cell density, and orientational order – properties that are inextricably entangled in conventional diffusion MRI. Key to disentangling all these microstructural features is MRI signal acquisition combining isotropic and directional dimensions, just as in the field of multidimensional solid-state NMR from which most of the ideas for the new methods are derived.},

We investigated the intrinsic functional connectivity of PAG using resting fMRI data from 100 subjects. The results showed that PAG is functionally connected to ACC (rostral and pregenual ACC) and also rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), forming a core ACC-PAG-RVM network for pain modulation even no pain stimulus is applied. The comparison between genders showed that for the contrast of female minus male, significant difference was observed at mid-cingulate cortex; for the contrast of male minus female, significant differences were observed at left medial orbital prefrontal cortex, and uncus; right insula/operculum and prefrontal cortex.We believe eluciation of this intrinsic PAG network duing the resting state will enhance our physiological and pathological understandings of the development and maintenance of chronic pain states. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Basser1994,
abstract = {This paper describes a new NMR imaging modality--MR diffusion tensor imaging. It consists of estimating an effective diffusion tensor, Deff, within a voxel, and then displaying useful quantities derived from it. We show how the phenomenon of anisotropic diffusion of water (or metabolites) in anisotropic tissues, measured noninvasively by these NMR methods, is exploited to determine fiber tract orientation and mean particle displacements. Once Deff is estimated from a series of NMR pulsed-gradient, spin-echo experiments, a tissue's three orthotropic axes can be determined. They coincide with the eigenvectors of Deff, while the effective diffusivities along these orthotropic directions are the eigenvalues of Deff. Diffusion ellipsoids, constructed in each voxel from Deff, depict both these orthotropic axes and the mean diffusion distances in these directions. Moreover, the three scalar invariants of Deff, which are independent of the tissue's orientation in the laboratory frame of reference, reveal useful information about molecular mobility reflective of local microstructure and anatomy. Inherently tensors (like Deff) describing transport processes in anisotropic media contain new information within a macroscopic voxel that scalars (such as the apparent diffusivity, proton density, T1, and T2) do not. {\textcopyright} 1994, The Biophysical Society.

abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has become one of the most popular MRI techniques in brain research, as well as in clinical practice. The number of brain studies with DTI is growing steadily and, over the last decade, has produced more than 700 publications. Diffusion tensor imaging enables visualization and characterization of white matter fascicli in two and three dimensions. Since the introduction of this methodology in 1994, it has been used to study the white matter architecture and integrity of the normal and diseased brains (multiple sclerosis, stroke, aging, dementia, schizophrenia, etc.). Although it provided image contrast that was not available with routine MR techniques, unique information on white matter and 3D visualization of neuronal pathways, many questions were raised regarding the origin of the DTI signal. Diffusion tensor imaging is constantly validated, challenged, and developed in terms of acquisition scheme, image processing, analysis, and interpretation. While DTI offers a powerful tool to study and visualize white matter, it suffers from inherent artifacts and limitations. The partial volume effect and the inability of the model to cope with non-Gaussian diffusion are its two main drawbacks. Nevertheless, when combined with functional brain mapping, DTI provides an efficient tool for comprehensive, noninvasive, functional anatomy mapping of the human brain. This review summarizes the development of DTI in the last decade with respect to the specificity and utility of the technique in radiology and anatomy studies.},

abstract = {Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are often small compared to the level of noise in the data. The sources of noise are numerous including different kinds of motion artifacts and physiological noise with complex patterns. This complicates the statistical analysis of the fMRI data. In this study, we propose an automatic method to reduce fMRI artifacts based on independent component analysis (ICA). We trained a supervised classifier to distinguish between independent components relating to a potentially task-related signal and independent components clearly relating to structured noise. After the components had been classified as either signal or noise, a denoised fMR time-series was reconstructed based only on the independent components classified as potentially task-related. The classifier was a novel global (fixed structure) decision tree trained in a Neyman-Pearson (NP) framework, which allowed the shape of the decision regions to be controlled effectively. Additionally, the conservativeness of the classifier could be tuned by modifying the NP threshold. The classifier was tested against the component classifications by an expert with the data from a category learning task. The test set as well as the expert were different from the data used for classifier training and the expert labeling the training set. The misclassification rate was between 0.2 and 0.3 for both the event-related and blocked designs and it was consistent among variety of different NP thresholds. The effects of denoising on the group-level statistical analyses were as expected: The denoising generally decreased Z-scores in the white matter, where extreme Z-values can be expected to reflect artifacts. A similar but weaker decrease in Z-scores was observed in the gray matter on average. These two observations suggest that denoising was likely to reduce artifacts from gray matter and could be useful to improve the detection of activations. We conclude that automatic ICA-based denoising offers a potentially useful approach to improve the quality of fMRI data and consequently increase the accuracy of the statistical analysis of these data. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {This study investigated the possible benefit of subject specific optimization of preprocessing strategies in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments. The optimization was performed using the data-driven performance metrics developed recently [Neuroimage 15 (2002), 747]. We applied numerous preprocessing strategies and a multivariate statistical analysis to each of the 20 subjects in our two example fMRI data sets. We found that the optimal preprocessing strategy varied, in general, from subject to subject. For example, in one data set, optimum smoothing levels varied from 16 mm (4 subjects), 10 mm (5 subjects), to no smoothing at all (1 subject). This strongly suggests that group-specific preprocessing schemes may not give optimum results. For both studies, optimizing the preprocessing for each subject resulted in an increased number of suprathresholded voxels in within-subject analyses. Furthermore, we demonstrated that we were able to aggregate the optimized data with a random effects group analysis, resulting in improved sensitivity in one study and the detection of interesting, previously undetected results in the other. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

@article{Salimi-Khorshidi2014,
abstract = {Many sources of fluctuation contribute to the fMRI signal, and this makes identifying the effects that are truly related to the underlying neuronal activity difficult. Independent component analysis (ICA) - one of the most widely used techniques for the exploratory analysis of fMRI data - has shown to be a powerful technique in identifying various sources of neuronally-related and artefactual fluctuation in fMRI data (both with the application of external stimuli and with the subject "at rest"). ICA decomposes fMRI data into patterns of activity (a set of spatial maps and their corresponding time series) that are statistically independent and add linearly to explain voxel-wise time series. Given the set of ICA components, if the components representing "signal" (brain activity) can be distinguished form the "noise" components (effects of motion, non-neuronal physiology, scanner artefacts and other nuisance sources), the latter can then be removed from the data, providing an effective cleanup of structured noise. Manual classification of components is labour intensive and requires expertise; hence, a fully automatic noise detection algorithm that can reliably detect various types of noise sources (in both task and resting fMRI) is desirable. In this paper, we introduce FIX ("FMRIB's ICA-based X-noiseifier"), which provides an automatic solution for denoising fMRI data via accurate classification of ICA components. For each ICA component FIX generates a large number of distinct spatial and temporal features, each describing a different aspect of the data (e.g., what proportion of temporal fluctuations are at high frequencies). The set of features is then fed into a multi-level classifier (built around several different classifiers). Once trained through the hand-classification of a sufficient number of training datasets, the classifier can then automatically classify new datasets. The noise components can then be subtracted from (or regressed out of) the original data, to provide automated cleanup. On conventional resting-state fMRI (rfMRI) single-run datasets, FIX achieved about 95{\%} overall accuracy. On high-quality rfMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, FIX achieves over 99{\%} classification accuracy, and as a result is being used in the default rfMRI processing pipeline for generating HCP connectomes. FIX is publicly available as a plugin for FSL. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

This book includes figures and CMR examples in the form of high-resolution still images and is divided in two sections: basic MRI physics, i.e. the nuts and bolts of MR imaging; and imaging techniques (pulse sequences) used in cardiovascular MR imaging. Each imaging technique is discussed in a separate chapter that includes the physics and clinical applications (with cardiovascular examples) of a particular technique. Evolving techniques or research based techniques are discussed as well. This section covers both cardiac and vascular imaging. ​Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is now considered a clinically important imaging modality for patients with a wide variety of cardiovascular diseases. Recent developments in scanner hardware, imaging sequences, and analysis software have led to 3-dimensional, high-resolution imaging of the cardiovascular system. These developments have also influenced a wide variety of cardiovascular imaging applications and it is now routinely used in clinical practice in CMR laboratories around the world. The non-invasiveness and lack of ionizing radiation exposure make CMR uniquely important for patients whose clinical condition requires serial imaging follow-up. This is particularly true for patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) with or without surgical corrections who require lifelong clinical and imaging follow-up.},
